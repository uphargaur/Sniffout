## Key Features

- **Location Permission and GPS Access**: The app prompts users to grant location permissions and access to their device's GPS for accurate and up-to-date location tracking.

- **Real-Time Location Display**: Using the Google Maps API, the app provides a visually appealing and interactive map interface that shows the user's live location in real-time.

- **MVVM Architecture and LiveData**: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, separating the presentation logic from the data layer. LiveData is used to observe and update the UI with the latest location data.

- **Fragment Integration**: The app utilizes fragments to divide the user interface into modular components, enhancing code reusability, and providing a seamless user experience across various screen sizes and orientations.

- **Nearby Location Retrieval**: Leveraging the power of Retrofit API, the app fetches nearby locations based on the user's current location. This feature enables users to discover and explore places of interest in their vicinity.
